Welcome back to the Uppercut, and apologies for the delayed post this week. It’s all been happening here, with Eddie Jones even giving the blog a shoutout, telling the Australian rugby media to ‘give yourselves uppercuts’ clearly referring them to this site in order to improve their standard of writing!

Moving on, this week I was lucky enough to attend the Ireland-England warm-up match for the Rugby World Cup, and that will be the lead-off, followed by a review of the Women’s World Cup final, and the latest from the Premier League. Enjoy!

## Earls Just Wants to Have Fun

The sound that erupted around the Aviva Stadium in the 74th-minute as Keith Earls somersaulted over the try line was a true testament to his standing in the eyes of the Irish rugby public, and the most fitting of tributes in what was most likely his final time representing Ireland at home. Winning his 100th cap, the Moyross man could hardly have imagined a better outcome, albeit he was made to wait a full hour until he was introduced for James Lowe. In true Earls fashion, he later confessed to being nervous while sitting on the bench about being an unused substitute and that the fanfare would be for nought. I’m not sure Andy Farrell would have maintained his popularity had that been the case! 

In the end, Earls’ try and Jack Crowley’s touchline conversion put the finishing touches on a 29-10 win for Ireland over their old enemy England, and in truth the scoreline flattered the visitors. Ireland dominated large portions of the game and looked the more dangerous team by a country mile, but handling errors and sloppy penalties meant they lacked the clinical edge that has seen them blow other opponents away. Farrell will be happy with getting most of his front-liners their first minutes of the new season, and while they will face stiffer opposition when the World Cup finally begins in a few weeks time, this was an important hit-out against a team that competed in every facet of the game, not least the lineout. Forwards coach Paul O’Connell will no doubt be analysing the game footage to identify exactly went wrong, as time and again Ireland gained excellent footholds in their opposition’s half only to forfeit possession through their malfunctioning set-piece. When Ireland did click, they played some lovely rugby and the skills with ball-in-hand were evident for everyone to see, some long passes enough to stretch the England defence beyond breaking point. They also threw in a lovely little wrinkle for Garry Ringrose’s try as Mack Hansen came off his wing to show off his phenomenal footballing ability, putting in a lovely cross-kick to Ringrose who had an easy step-and-run to finish off the move.

There were a few players for whom this game was vital to their standing in the squad, both in terms of their position within the World Cup squad and whether they’d be on the plane at all. Ross Byrne was looking to banish the ghosts of 4 years ago, when much of the blame for that pre-World Cup capitulation was unfairly placed on his shoulders. From my vantage point, I thought he was solid if unspectacular, facilitating those around him while not having many standout moments. However, that is the nature of his game and with him being a near-lock for the final squad, Farrell will be pleased to see him get his first minutes since Leinster’s collapse against La Rochelle in the European Cup final. His place-kicking, usually such a strength of his game, was off and meant the score stayed closer than it should have, but I wouldn’t worry too much about that as he has proven a world-class kicker in the toughest of situations. The debate between himself and Jack Crowley is likely to continue until Farrell names his squad to play South Africa(with both out-halves likely to see game time in the two games before then), but it will be fascinating to see who gets the nod for the final warm-up game against Samoa in Bayonne this Saturday. If Crowley starts and has a good game, will he nose ahead of Byrne in the pecking order? Or could we see Ciaran Frawley get a first test start and make a late push for the squad? The former is certainly more likely than the latter, but never say never.

Another man eager to seize his opportunity was Connacht’s Cian Prendergast, starting at 8 for the first time in green. He got off to an inauspicious start, having the ball ripped from him near the English line, but settled into the game with a thumping tackle on Billy Vunipola before winning a turnover on the next phase. Like Byrne, he was solid throughout, but will face a nervous wait to see if he has done enough to force his way into the squad. It probably comes down to how Farrell and the coaching staff choose to split between forwards and backs, with Prendergast’s fate likely tied to that of Ulster centre Stuart McCloskey, who is likely to feature this weekend. The biggest area of concern to arise during the game for Ireland was the sight of star hooker Dan Sheehan limping off with what appeared to be a bad ankle. It was not immediately clear what had caused the injury, but head coach Farrell was not overly optimistic in his post-game press conference. Sheehan, widely regarded as the finest player at his position in the game, will await the results of his scans to see how much a part, if any, he will play at the World Cup, and his loss would be a huge blow to Ireland. Sheehan’s replacement, Leinster teammate Ronan Kelleher, is a fantastic player in his own right, but has had a poor track record with injuries and indeed has not featured so far in the build-up to the tournament. If Sheehan is likely to miss time but return at some point in the World Cup, do the coaches take a risk on Kelleher, leaving them potentially exposed to injury? Or do they opt for the explosive but inexperienced Tom Stewart, who went well against Italy two weeks ago and will surely see time again this weekend? That Farrell is yet to name his squad has created an interesting dynamic around this final game, but all will be revealed by this time next week.

While Ireland look strong, those across the Irish Sea would be looking at a bleak World Cup were it not for the ridiculously one-sided draw. England and Wales have both looked lost for much of the pre-season, playing rugby that looks miles behind the front-runners. England barely threatened the Irish line all game, and the Irish defence had little trouble diagnosing their phase play. They kicked early and often, but to little avail. However, their attacking woes are just one of a number of worries, as ill discipline threatens to derail any chance at a smooth build-up. Following on from last week’s debacle with Owen Farrell(which continues into this week after World Rugby appealed, correctly in my opinion, the decision to rescind his red card), Billy Vunipola learned nothing from his teammate’s mistakes when putting his shoulder into Andrew Porter’s face on Saturday, thus earning himself a red card all of his own. Coach Steve Borthwick should get clarity on both players this week, but both are likely to cop lengthy bans that will affect their World Cup. There are few positions in the world of rugby I would less like to be in than that of England coach right now. Wales, for their part, suffered their worst ever defeat under Warren Gatland, falling 52-16 at home to the Springboks, albeit while resting many of their front-line players. They have named their World Cup squad and while there is excitement at the youth coming through, this very much feels like a squad who will be more ready to compete in 4 years time, similar to France 4 years ago. Happily for them, their main pool rivals Australia have done much the same as they look to a home advantage in 2027, Eddie Jones opting to leave veterans Michael Hooper and Quade Cooper at home much to the Australian public’s disappointment. Georgia and Fiji, two of the better Tier 2 nations, also make up their pool and will both be licking their chops at the prospect of knocking off one or two of the vulnerable Tier 1 nations.

## Money Can’t Buy You Wins
Last week, I lamented the fact that were Chelsea to be successful after their extraordinary spending spree, it would be dismissed as ‘buying the league’. A week on and that seems a suddenly-desirable outcome, when considering the 3-1 defeat to London rivals West Ham on Sunday that has left them the laughing stock of the league. Despite the positive signs shown against Liverpool, Chelsea were up to their old tricks again, missing chances and gifting opponents soft goals despite dominating possession statistics. While it was always going to take time to gel, dropping such large sums should come with a guarantee of quality, but too often their expensive stars came up short in the biggest moments. Enzo Fernandez(£106.8m from Benfica) missed a penalty that would have seen Chelsea take the lead at the break, while Moises Caicedo(£115m from Brighton) conceded a penalty late-on after making his debut off the bench. The only player who seemed to belong on the pitch was Raheem Sterling, who put in his best performance as a Chelsea player since he joined last summer. While I think new manager Mauricio Pochettino is the man to get this team back where it belongs, it was certainly jarring to see the ghosts of last season rearing their ugly heads again. The new signings deserve time to get acclimated, but the restless fan base wont’t stand for many more results like this.

One London team who are not struggling under a new manager are Tottenham, who are playing with a newfound freedom under Ange Postecoglou. After an entertaining 2-2 draw away to Brentford in their first game, Spurs welcomed Manchester United to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium looking to test their mettle against the side who supplanted them in 4th place last season. After losing their captain and goalscoring maestro, Harry Kane, to Bayern Munich, few would have thought Spurs could live with the Red Devils but in fact they looked the far more energetic and positive team, with Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr running the midfield. Spurs were lucky not to concede when United were denied a penalty for what looked like a clear handball by defender Cristian Romero, but from there is was all one-way traffic. Just after the break, Sarr broke the deadlock with his first goal for the club, before their attacking intent bore fruit once again as Lisandro Martinez deflected the ball into his own net to put the result beyond doubt. Where Tottenham’s midfield excelled, United’s new combination of Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes, backed up by Casemiro, have struggled to put United on the front foot so far this season. Going forward, it’ll be interesting to see if Ten Hag gives the trio time to gel or if he decides to ring the changes. Out of the three, Mount, despite his price tag, seems the most ‘droppable’, but the options behind don’t inspire too much optimism. For the man known as ‘Ten Heisenberg’ for his likeness to Brian Cranston’s famous character from Breaking Bad, it will be vital that United’s manager finds the right formula as soon as possible.

Speaking of finding the right formula, Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton team have picked up right where they left off last season, racking up back-to-back 4-1 wins to currently sit atop the table. While critics will point to the standard of opposition(Luton and Wolves won’t be competing for Europe any time soon), the quality of their play has been evident to see, with the fast-paced, flowing nature of their attack a thrill to watch. Their endless conveyor belt of talent shows no sign of slowing, as they have seamlessly moved on from the big-name losses of Alexis McAllister and Moises Caicedo while pocketing around £120m in profits, making them the envy of the Premier League. Perhaps the commencement of European football in a few weeks time will halt their momentum, but their young squad should be well able to manage the increased load. 

Elsewhere, Manchester City passed one of their biggest tests of the season, beating Newcastle 1-0 at St. James’ Park just days after defeating Sevilla to win the UEFA Super Cup for the first time in their history. A first-half strike from Julian Alvarez, deservedly seeing more game time this season, was enough to see the Citizens win this iteration of the Gulf Owners derby. Arsenal also continued their run with a close win away to Crystal Palace. Arsenal haven’t looked too mighty so far this season, but winning while not playing their best is the sign of a good team, and I think it is only a matter of time before they are firing on all cylinders.

## No Spain No Gain
And so England end yet another tournament in heartbreak. In the build up to the final of the Women’s World Cup, many were tipping the Lionesses to match the feat of the men’s team of 1966, and end the 57 years of hurt that have followed since. After their composed, clinical performance against the Matildas on Wednesday, they looked primed to ensure England would be the first nation to lift the World Cup in both codes. But, after 90 intense minutes(plus extra time) at Stadium Australia on Sunday, that honour instead belonged to their European counterparts Spain, who produced possibly their best performance of the tournament when it mattered most. In truth, despite the 1-0 scoreline, Spain dominated this game, and even the most ardent of English supporters could not deny that they were deserved winners. In attack, their intricate passing was on show as they skilfully evaded the 
English press, and in defence they swarmed and harried the opposition to win the ball back. Lauren Hemp struck the crossbar for England early on, but that was to prove their best chance of the night as Spain grew into the game. When left-back Lucy Bronze, playing against many of her Barcelona teammates, went on an ill-advised run before losing the ball in the centre circle, Spain ruthlessly exploited the space left behind her before captain Olga Carmona slotted the ball past Mary Earps, to the delight of the many Spaniards in the crowd. England manager Sarina Wiegman, coaching her second successive World Cup final having experienced defeat with the Netherlands 4 years previously, rang the changes at half-time, springing Lauren James from the bench having returned from suspension. But the changes didn’t have the desired effect, and Spain continued to look the more dangerous side. England briefly threatened to turn the tide when Earps saved Jenni Hermoso’s penalty, awarded for a handball, with the English fans finally finding their voice to try to help their team push for an equaliser. But the game petered out as Spain suffocated their opponents, and collapsed to their knees in joyous celebration when the final whistle went.

Unfortunately, the game’s aftermath made as many headlines as the match itself. As last week’s readers would know, the Spanish team have had a strained relationship with their manager, Jorge Vilda, since a player revolt was squashed last year. Amid the celebrations, this tension was plain for all to see, as Vilda’s attempts to celebrate with his team were largely rejected by the victorious players, culminating in the team basically turning their backs on him as he tried to enter their dance circle. It is almost absurd to wonder whether a World Cup-winning manager is on the verge on being sacked, but it is the view of many in Spain that this squad triumphed not because of Vilda, but rather in spite of him. Indeed, were Vilda not the coach, Spain would have had 4 of the best players in the world in their squad, and could have romped to the title. Vilda’s position is made all the more tenuous due to the actions of his biggest backer, Spanish FA President Luis Rubiales. As if grabbing his crotch in celebration at the final whistle wasn’t vile enough, Rubiales proceeded to forcibly kiss legendary forward Jenni Hermoso as she made her way through the podium to receive her medal. Not only were his actions disgusting and emblematic of the problems women’s football still faces in gaining the respect it deserves, they have also served to divert attention away from the victorious players. Here’s hoping he heeds the calls from the highest positions of Spain’s government to resign, and we can get back to celebrating the achievements of those on the pitch. Finally, a word for Spain captain Olga Carmona. Her friends and family took the decision to delay informing the left-back of her father’s passing after a long-term illness days before the final to allow her to focus on the game, and as fate would have it she would go on to score the deciding goal in the biggest game of her life. A tragic story, but I hope she looks back at the day with pride. Perhaps her role in the history-making team was the finest tribute of all.

To end on a positive note, the tournament as a whole was a roaring success. Every iteration gains more and more interest, and the level of media coverage has has also kept people engaged throughout. Attendance figures hit nearly 2 million people, an almost 50% increase on the previous record set in Canada in 2015, while the average attendance per game of 31,000 was also a new record. TV viewing figures rose dramatically, with an estimated audience of over 2 billion viewers across the competition. Sunday’s final was the 2nd-most watched event in the UK this year, behind King Charles’ coronation. All these figures point to the progress being made to bring the women’s game on a level footing with the men’s, but no one is denying there is still work to do. At home, the Girls in Green’s qualification for the first time has vastly increased interest in their endeavours, and hopefully they can use this momentum to go from strength-to-strength as they push for qualification for the next European Championships, which would also be a first. This writer will certainly be following them with a far keener eye, and hopefully they can inspire young girls around the country to ignore the naysayers and follow their footballing passions.

## Overtime
### Agony in Budapest
The World Athletics Championships have been taking place in Budapest this past week, and a supremely talented Irish squad went in with real medal aspirations. For a nation not known for its prowess in the field of athletics, this in itself marks a big change, and hopefully represents a sign of things to come. Unfortunately for Ireland, two of our best hopes fell agonisingly short, with Ciara Mageean finishing 4th in the 1500m on Tuesday night, before 20-year old Rhasidat Adeleke repeated the feat in the 400m two days later. 4th in the world is nothing to be sniffed at, and both runners will now set their sights on going even better when the Olympics rolls around in France next year.

### Djokovic’s Revenge
Novak Djokovic got his revenge for his defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final by defeating the Spaniard in a thrilling final at the Cincinnati Open, the last tournament before the U.S. Open begins next week. Djokovic saved a match point in the 2nd set having lost the 1st, before going on to win consecutive tie-breakers to claim the title. Few would bet against these two having another title showdown at Flushing Meadows in a couple weeks’ time.

On the women’s side of the draw, American teenager Coco Gauff claimed her 3rd title of the year, beating Karolina Muchova of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-4 to set herself up nicely for the last Grand Slam of the year. Still only 19 despite being on the tennis scene for some years, this is arguably the biggest title of her young career, and her victory over top-seed Iga Swiatek at the penultimate stage will give her great confidence as she looks to harness the support of the home crowd next week.

### Viktor-y
Viktor Hovland shot a stunning 9-under in the final round of the BMW Championship, the penultimate stage of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, to narrowly pip Scottie Scheffler and Matthew Fitzpatrick to the title. He has set himself up well for the final stage in Atlanta this weekend, where players will compete for the $18m prize. Scottie Scheffler goes into the weekend ranked first based on his performances throughout the season and will therefore hold a 2-shot lead over Hovland, with Rory McIlroy one shot back of the Norwegian. Players start on different scores based on their ranking going into the weekend, and the player who ultimately ends up with the lowest score will take home the jackpot.

That’s all for this week folks! It’s possible there will be no Uppercut next week as I work on previews for the Rugby World Cup and new NFL season, but maybe there’ll be a short edition if there’s any news worth covering. Thanks for reading, and as always feel free to get in contact with any thoughts/comments!
