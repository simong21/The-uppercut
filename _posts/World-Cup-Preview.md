Has it really only been 4 years? When Cheslin Kolbe danced around Owen Farrell to put the finishing touches on a 32-12 domination of England in Yokohama, securing South Africa’s record-equalling 3rd World Cup, the idea of being forced to stay indoors due to a dangerous, infectious plague was confined to the imaginations of Hollywood writers, and many thought that Donald Trump would facilitate a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the following year’s election. Well, maybe not that last one. But a lot has happened since then, including in the world of rugby, where power dynamics have ebbed and flowed, and the game has(thankfully) evolved from that brutal final in 2019 to one where pace and handling are king.

The alarm bells were ringing when, in the midst of the pandemic, the Lions travelled down to take on the reigning World Cup champions in their own backyard. What should have been an enthralling series will be remembered as hopefully the nadir of test rugby, where both teams refused to create any sort of a watchable product, choosing rather to try to batter the opposition into submission, and when that didn’t work, punt the ball skywards in the hopes of winning a penalty or the put-in to a set-piece. What could have been the death knell for a sport already struggling to attract new fans instead marked a turning point, as France and Ireland would debut exciting new attacking styles, both markedly different from each other, later that year, with both recording victories over the illustrious New Zealand All Blacks. For much of the next 15 months, they were the pre-eminent teams in world rugby as teams searched for ways to slow them down. 

Despite the success, there was never any complacency when it came to thinking about the World Cup. New Zealand and South Africa, tied for the most World Cup triumphs with 3 each, were never going to allow the upstarts from the Northern Hemisphere to have it all their own way, and during this year’s Rugby Championship showed they have been building potent gameplans of their own. With those two giants appearing to peak at just the right time, along with the emergence of the best Scottish team of my lifetime, this World Cup is shaping up to be one of the most open in recent memory. Unfortunately, due to the ridiculous decision to have the draw take place 3 years prior to the actual event, all 5 of the aforementioned teams now find themselves in the same side of the draw. While this will make for some mouth-watering clashes at the quarter-final stage, it means 3 of the top 5 ranked teams in the world are guaranteed to be eliminated before the semi-finals. From an Irish perspective, it makes our road to a first ever semi-final even tougher, a bitter pill to swallow considering the form the team have shown in recent years. But to be the best, one must beat the best, and every team will quietly believe they have the quality to lift the William Webb Ellis trophy at the Stade de France on October 28th. Bring it on.

## Pool A
### The Kids are Alldritt - France
Ever since France were awarded the right to host the World Cup in late 2017, they have been building towards this moment. They swiftly jettisoned older players who would not be around for 2023, and brought a young squad to Japan in 2019 to ensure that when this iteration rolled around, their players would be primed to perform and, with any luck, lift the trophy on home soil. When it comes to World Cups, the saying ‘ever the bridesmaid, never the bride’ truly applies to the French. 3-time runners-up and semi-finalists on 3 further occasions, the tournament has been non-stop heartbreak for a rugby-mad public, and you can be sure they will be roaring on Les Bleus with gusto at every step of the way. 

And what a team it is. Having finally resolved their differences with the domestic clubs, who for years flogged their players in terms of game time with no regard for the national team, the Federation has put the team in the best place to succeed. They have tapped into their incredible depth while unearthing some generational talents to assemble the most complete squad in World Rugby, led by the world’s best player, the irresistible Antoine Dupont. Marshalling his troops from the base of the ruck, ‘Le Petit Général’ makes this team tick, whether it be finishing off length-of-the-field tries with his superb support lines, or getting his team out of a sticky situation with his smarts and surprising strength for a man of his size. His importance to this team is all the greater with the loss of out-half Romain Ntamack just weeks before the tournament, and Mathieu Jalibert will have big boots to fill in the pivotal ‘10’ role. 

While their devastating back line can create something from absolutely nothing, it is France’s forward pack that sees them claim the title of favourites for the World Cup. Size-wise, they can match up to even South Africa(knowing for their physicality and generally enormous humans), and over the course of 80 minutes will pound most opposition teams into submission. However, they would take umbrage were I to label them one-trick ponies. For such large men, their ball-handling skills are sublime, and their ability to free their hands and get offloads away create massive headaches for defensive coaches. Number 8 Gregory Aldritt, fresh off a European Cup triumph with La Rochelle, will look to provide his team with front-foot ball, while Thibaud Flament is a menace both with ball in hand and while disrupting opposition lineouts. The loss of Cyril Baille for at least the early portion of the tournament is a huge blow, but one they can survive, and he could return fresh for the latter stages.

Ultimately, France’s fate is in their hands. While having the backing of a vociferous home support can be a huge advantage, it also brings a lot of pressure. The fans know how good this team is, and anything less than a first World Cup victory will be a disappointment. They have the talent and experience to go the whole way, and it will take the performance of performances to beat them. Still, their road to victory is anything but easy, and any triumph will be well deserved as they look to become only the second Northern Hemisphere nation to lift the William Webb Ellis trophy.

### You Gotta Be Schmidting Me - New Zealand
New Zealand enter this tournament in unfamiliar territory: NOT the favourites. Having dominated the rugby landscape for the entire professional era and beyond, the All Blacks have had their aura of invincibility, once great enough to nearly win matches before they had begun, slowly whittled away over the last few years, to the point where the damage may be permanent. I’m not saying they will never win a World Cup again, but the fear they used to instil in their opponents may never return to the levels of, say, 2015, when they crushed all in their way. The cause for this has been two-fold: this current crop of players don’t seem to quite possess the same awesome talent of past generations; and the structure and organisation of rugby defences has come on leaps and bounds, meaning the superior skills and athleticism don’t produce the same impact on the scoreboard as they once did. 

At this point, you might think I’m predicting New Zealand to not even make it out of their group what with all the doom and gloom, but this is purely comparing them to teams of tournaments-past. This All Blacks team are still incredibly dangerous, and will be a tough out for any opponent. Players like Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett are World Cup winners and possess the ability to bring a crowd to their feet. Beauden’s brother Jordie is a monster in the centre of the pitch, and flying wingers Will Jordan and Mark Telea are among the best finishers in the world. In this year’s Rugby Championship, former Ireland coach Joe Schmidt’s fingerprints were all over the gameplan as they were able to play structured, fast-paced rugby to create gaps in the defence, before using their game-breakers to exploit them. Their ruck accuracy was key, and if they can get quick ball there are not many defences capable of shutting them down.

The All Blacks’ weakness lies in their forward pack. The common thread in their 9 losses since their defeat to England at the semi-final last time around has been losing the battle up front, and not always to bigger packs(see: Ireland). In the modern era, parity up front is required at the very least to have a chance to compete, and the All Blacks have too often been found wanting in that department. They have had to deal with a slew of retirements in recent years, and the likes of Shannon Frizell and Sam Cane cannot hold a candle to legends like Jerome Kaino and Richie McCaw. In Ardie Savea they boast arguably the premier number 8 in the world, but he is asked to do a lot and cannot always be expected to pick up his teammates’ slack. They have shown signs of improving, and their forwards were able to provide excellent platforms throughout the Rugby Championship, but one must wonder how damaging the recent 35-7 defeat at the hands of the Springboks will have been to their confidence, as they were manhandled off the park.

The All Blacks at a World Cup are never to be underestimated, and you can bet none of their opponents will look forward to facing them. But they are as vulnerable as they have been in recent memory, and teams will know that if they can win the collisions and get in their faces, their chances of victory will rise sharply. Perhaps they will relish this newfound underdogs tag, but the prospect of opening their tournament against a fired-up France is not all too enticing. A poor performance in that game could reinforce the feeling that this team does not have what it takes to be champions.

### Gone in Azzurri - Italy
What a shame it is that the year Italy bring perhaps their strongest team ever to a World Cup, they are drawn in the same pool as France and New Zealand. Having shown signs of life in the 2022 6 Nations, when their place in the tournament was being questioned, Italy didn’t quite push on as many had hoped in this year’s championship, but have displayed the type of attacking structures and fight that have long been missing, pushing Ireland and France right to the brink. Had they been lucky enough to get a spot in Pools C or D, they would be looking at the very real prospect of a first ever quarter-final, but unfortunately it looks a step too far for them this time around.

The departing head coach Kieran Crowley has left his mark on this team, massively improving their fitness levels and installing an exciting style of play. But perhaps his biggest achievement has been in instilling a real belief that they belong on the same pitch as rugby’s biggest teams, and that has been evident in the way they have played without fear over the last 18 months. It helps that the youth system has finally produced genuine talent in players like out-half Paolo Garbisi, flanker and captain Michele Lamaro and the electric Ange Capuozzo. Their pack has size and can play with ball in hand, but a lack of accuracy in areas like the breakdown and lineout have been their downfall.

For Italy, the best they can likely hope for is to dispatch Uruguay and Namibia with ease, and put up a fight against the two heavyweights of the group. Could they pull off the unthinkable against either? It would certainly be the biggest upset in the tournament’s history, but stranger things have certainly happened. Here’s hoping Italy push on over the next 4 years, and are in a position to mount a real push for the quarter finals in Australia in 2027.

### The Also-Rans - Uruguay and Namibia
One of rugby’s greatest weaknesses is its lack of depth in terms of top teams, meaning that in every pool there are the also-rans. The chances of an upset from these teams are nigh-on zero, so their focus will almost exclusively be on defeating each other. Namibia have played in every World Cup since 1999, but are yet to register a win, their closest defeat coming against Georgia in 2015, when they lost 17-16. Uruguay are rugby royalty in comparison, winning one match in 1999 and 2003, and in 2019 recorded their most famous victory in turning over Fiji, 30-27 in an enthralling clash. They will be favourites going into the clash between the two when they go toe-to-toe on September 27th, as both teams look to avoid finishing last in the pool.

## Pool B
### Bok-to-Bok?
4 years ago, South Africa went into the World Cup in Japan as heavy underdogs, having suffered a string of poor defeats including a first-ever loss to Italy, resulting in a change of coach just 18 months out from the tournament. Going against the ‘4-year cycle’, the process of building a strategy over years to peak just at the right time, was at the time seen as a major misstep, and few thought the Springboks could really compete for the title. However, Rassie Erasmus and his band of colossi didn’t get the memo, and arrived with a punishing, and frankly boring style of rugby. Boring but effective. Brutalising the opposition up front before unleashing their lightning quick outside-backs proved too much for all to handle, and at the end of the tournament it was not style points that counted but those on the scoreboard.

Now, 4 years on from that triumph, the Springboks may be even better. Much of their pack is still around, and their depth has only increased, meaning that when they deployed 7 forwards(!) from the bench in last week’s warm-up against New Zealand, the quality departing the pitch was no greater than that coming on. A scary prospect for any opponent to ponder. They have even started to show some new patterns in their backline, and still possess a potent kicking game in case things go awry. Looking for a weakness in this Springboks team is like looking for a needle in a haystack, and there’s no guarantee the needle is there in the first place.

It is tough to single out any of their forwards such is the talent across the board, but former World Player of the Year Pieter-Steph du Toit is a good place to start. The second-row-cum-flanker is a nightmare for anyone to tackle, and possesses the pace to run away from most backs. Ally that with his excellent offloading ability, and you have one of the most complete players in the world. Hooker Malcolm Marx boasts extraordinary dynamism and an eye for the line. Look for him to get behind many a rolling maul near the try-line. And it would be an enormous oversight to not spare a word for inspirational captain Siya Kolisi, who has returned to the starting XV just 5 months after partially tearing his ACL. South Africa’s first ever black captain, he is one of the game’s greatest ambassadors, a warrior on the field and a true gentleman off it. His importance to this team simply cannot be overstated.

In the backline, wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe can score from anywhere, and the emergence of 20-year old Canan Moodie has made the loss of Lukhanyo Am, key to the Springboks’ victory in 2019, appear suddenly manageable, although there are murmurs that his inexperience may prevent him playing a huge role in the tournament. Another of South Africa’s World Cup winning backline, out-half Handre Pollard, has also missed out on the squad through injury. However, should his replacement, Manie Libbok, struggle in the early stages, I would not be at all surprised to see Pollard recalled given he is back training fully. His calmness and kicking game, not to mention his defensive strengths, complement those around him beautifully, and such is his experience that I wouldn’t have any worries about his lack of game time.

Their fans are rightly confident going into the tournament, given their pedigree and form. There are few teams in the world that can live with their pack, and even fewer who can also corral their sensational backline. Any team looking to defeat them must win their fair share of collisions, and seek to move the enormous pack around. And that is just the beginning, as they are likely to spring an equally dangerous, fresh set of forwards from the bench at some point in the second half. Still, anyone can win on the day, and Ireland, France and New Zealand have all beaten the ‘Boks in the last 12 months. Those looking for hope can also turn to history: South Africa have only won the World Cup in 1995, 2007 and 2019, so surely it can only be every 12 years, right?

### Johnny, Be Good - Ireland
The moment of truth has finally arrived for Andy Farrell’s men. Even though the successes of recent years, namely the series victory away to New Zealand last summer and winning the Grand Slam in this year’s 6 Nations, have rightly been celebrated as achievements in their own right, the squad and indeed the public have always had one eye on the Rugby World Cup. This is the big one for Ireland, the one that matters most, as the cloud of their repeated failures to progress past the quarter-final stage hangs over this team like a pall of dark smoke. We have grown accustomed to 6 Nations success and wins over big teams, but our World Cup track record is still used by opposing fans as a stick by which to beat us.

No Irish team has ever gone into a World Cup with such expectation. The world’s number 1 ranked side, Ireland have entertained with an attack that functions at breakneck speed, in which every ball carrier has multiple options, keeping the opposition guessing until the very last moment. More often than not, the Irish players choose the right options, and the when the attack is in full flow it is truly a thing of beauty, with Jamison Gibson-Park and inspirational captain Johnny Sexton pulling the strings from the half-back positions. In only one of Ireland’s 6 Nations games this year did they fail to achieve the 4-try bonus point, suggesting any team who wants to defeat them will need to score a lot of points. And doing so against this Irish team is no easy feat, as they are one of the stingiest defences in world rugby. Going back to the start of the 2022 6 Nations, they have conceded just 33 tries in 19 games, with 6 of those coming in the first test away to New Zealand. In a pool containing South Africa and Scotland, it may be that the defence is the difference between an early exit and making a quarter-final.

Even allowing for Ireland’s ‘golden generation’ of the late-00’s, this may be the most talented Irish squad ever assembled, certainly in terms of depth at the very least. In Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris, Ireland have two players who would walk into a World XV, both devastating with ball in hand while possessing the smarts that allow them their team-mates to flourish. Josh van der Flier is the reigning World Player of the Year(only the 3rd Irish player to have been awarded the honour, after Keith Wood and Johnny Sexton), while Tadhg Beirne can wreck an opponents gameplan almost single-handed lay with his poaching ability. With Irish legend Paul O’Connell coaching the forwards, Ireland possess perhaps the best lineout in the world, with an array of options available to them at every set-piece. However, coming off the warm-ups this was an area of major concern as the opposition was able to compete successfully, and they will have to iron out any issues if they hope to make a deep run.

While the pack forms the base of this Irish team, the backs are not simply passengers. They are perhaps the best passing side in this world, and have the ability throw inch-perfect 20-metre passes to hit team-mates in stride to exploit any weaknesses in an opposing defence. Garry Ringrose is the best defensive 13 in the world(with the possible exception of South Africa’s injured centre, Lukhanyo Am), and his ability to snuff out opposing attacks has been key to Ireland’s excellent defensive record. James Lowe and Mack Hansen may not be the most dynamic wingers in the world, but they read them game beautifully and are always seeking to get involved rather than simply waiting for the ball out wide. And at the back, Hugo Keenan oozes class both under the high ball and as a stand-in distributor in Ireland’s phase play.

I have said it before, but the draw for this World Cup is cruel. To break the quarter-final curse, Ireland will have to beat at least one of Scotland and South Africa, before a quarter-final against either hosts France or the All Blacks. To think an Irish side would hope to face New Zealand in a World Cup knockout game speaks to the difficulty of the situation, but then again Ireland are the number 1 side in the world for a reason. Over the past 15 months, they have beaten every tier 1 nation except for Argentina, so there should be no fear factor. When their attack is firing on all cylinders, there has not been a team capable of slowing them down, and their defence will keep them in every game regardless. This is Johnny Sexton’s last tournament for Ireland, and they will be doing their best to send off the great man in style. Screw the caution and pessimism that is so common in Irish supporters, it’s time to start dreaming that Ireland could lift the William Webb Ellis trophy in Paris in a few weeks. They have the talent to do it, and in sport, you simply never know.


### Finning Streak - Scotland
Scotland enter this World Cup determined to play spoiler. As the fifth-ranked side in the world, they have come on leaps and bounds in the last 4 years, when they crashed out in the group stages following losses to Ireland and Japan. For a long time, they were the whipping boys of the 6 Nations alongside Italy, but have shed that reputation in recent years as the current crop of players have come through and taken ownership of the jersey. Gone also are the self-destructive tendencies which held them back, most notably the unsanctioned nights-out during game weeks which led to high-profile suspensions from head coach Gregor Townsend. Townsend and maverick out-half Finn Russell have also put their differences behind them to the great benefit of the team, having not exactly seen eye-to-eye for a while.

Russell is key to how this team ticks as one of the most exciting most players in the world. His ability to take the ball to the line before putting a team-mate through a gap with a deft pass or offload, allied with a a creative kicking game, make him a huge headache for defence coaches. It is hard to think of a player more key to his team’s chances among the top teams than Russell is to Scotland, and they must hope the durability he has shown throughout his career carries into this tournament. Outside him, Scotland have a variety of threats, and South African born monster Duhan van der Merwe is up their with the very best wingers. For a long time, Scotland’s weakness was in their forward pack as other tier 1 nations could regularly gain the upper hand there, but now their forward pack is now chock-full of talent. Captain Jamie Ritchie is a born leader, while Grant Gilchrist and Richie Gray are an excellent duo in the second-row ‘engine room’. Like Ireland, Scotland’s forwards possess the ability to play with ball-in-hand, meaning defences must be wary of the offload.

Scotland are one of the dark horses of this year’s tournament, and have a very real chance of upsetting Ireland or South Africa to escape this group of death. However, they must learn to play for a full 80 minutes, rather than in fits and bursts. When they are on form, they are absolutely devastating and can pile up points at a rapid clip. But they also have a tendency to go to sleep and spot their opposition big leads. They have also shown a rather worrying trend of pushing big teams all the way, only to fall short in the end. If they want to avoid being knocked out at the group stage two World Cups in a row, they must show a ruthlessness we have not yet seen.

### The Also-Rans - Tonga and Romania
Looking at some of the names in the Tonga squad, it seems strange to call them ‘also-rans’. They have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of World Rugby’s rule change to allow those who haven’t represented their country in 3 years switch allegiances to another team for which they are qualified. For Tonga, former All Blacks Malakai Fekitoa, George Moala and Charles Piutau now bolster their ranks, and will make life difficult for every opponent. However, Pacific Island nations have never struggled in the athleticism department, but it is their breakdown and set-piece that usually can’t compete with the bigger nations. This is likely to be the case again, and while they may cause a scare, I don’t really see an upset being on the cards.

Romania are perennial World Cup attendees, despite having been disqualified from the 2019 iteration due to their breaking of player-eligibility rules. They have 6 World Cup wins, but have never won more than one in a single tournament. That is unlikely to change this year, as they are even weaker than usual. Their fixtures will be little more than training runs for the other members of the pool, and given the opposition there is a very real chance they will rank 20th out of 20 teams when all is said and done.

## Pool C
### Extended Warren-ty - Wales
Wales have so often outperformed their population size at World Cups, as there seems to be some mystical force that powers them when they pull on the red jersey, no matter how putrid their domestic sides may be at the time. They will need to call on all the fury of a dragon if they are to make noise at this iteration following the swathe of retirements that have occurred over the last few months. Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Ken Owens are just some of the mainstays of recent years that have decided to call time on their careers prior to the tournament, and as such Wales will bring a young squad to France. Following the last World Cup, Wayne Pivac took over head coaching duties from fellow Kiwi Warren Gatland, who has near-messianic status in Wales following his wildly successful tenure from 2007-2019. However, a turbulent few years saw Pivac fail to bring through any fresh players, resulting in an ageing squad that, at their lowest moment, fell to Georgia at home. The Welsh Rugby Union, in all sorts of financial difficulties, put out the Gat-symbol late last year, and Warren answered the call, meaning he will take Wales to a 4th successive World Cup.

His return got off to an inauspicious start in this year’s 6 Nations, as the side struggled for any kind of coherence, suffering convincing defeats to Ireland, Scotland and France. Wales’ tournament will perhaps be best remembered for the player revolt over new pay reforms brought in by the WRU, which briefly threatened to derail their fixture versus England. For now, those disputes have been put on hold, although rugby in Wales is likely to face a reckoning in the coming years.

In the pre-tournament warm-ups, Wales have shown a bit of progression in their attack, though it is still a long way off the teams at the top of the rankings. One thing you can guarantee of a Gatland-coached side is that they will be in excellent physical shape, and that alone may be enough to see them into the quarter-finals. Their squad is a blend of youth and experience, with very little in between, so it will be interesting to see how Gatland strikes a balance in the starting XV. Between Liam Williams, George North and the soon-to-be-retired Dan Biggar, Wales have players who know what it takes to reach a World Cup semi-final, and I would expect them to form the bulk of Wales’ leadership alongside co-captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake, both making their World Cup debuts with a combined 20 test match appearances between them.

Wales are facing a fight to get out of their group, with a strong Fijian side and an unpredictable Australia to deal with. Their squad does not have the talent that Gatland used to have at his disposal, but they have plenty of experienced operators to keep things on track. While they are still a while off some of the teams in the other side of the draw, they will fancy their chances in a potential quarter-final against Argentina or England. It would not surprise me to see Wales sneak into a semi-final yet again.

### Skelton Crew - Australia 
Australia enter this year’s World Cup as one of the great unknowns. On one hand, their results in the last year have been nothing short of putrid, losing every game in the Rugby Championship as well as each of their 2 subsequent warm-up games; on the other hand, Eddie Jones is a wily character and history has shown that he knows a thing or two about preparing his teams for a World Cup. That latter point is really all Australia fans have to lean on, as their team have shown very little ability to compete with the bigger teams beyond the odd 10-minute spell.

True to character, Jones has come out all guns blazing with the media, and has refused to temper expectations for his team. One can only imagine the ‘us against the world’ mentality he is fostering within that squad, and he’ll have plenty of bulletin board material from rugby journalists around the world who are writing them off. Whether that is enough to overcome their talent deficiencies is another question. While Jones is right to point to his young squad’s ‘room to grow’, I can’t think of an Australia World Cup team with fewer proven world-class operators than this one. Jones has never been afraid to make the big calls, and you certainly couldn’t accuse him of playing it safe after culling some big-name veterans when choosing his squad, most notably Michael Hooper and Quade Cooper. He has selected Leinster and Ireland nemesis Will Skelton as a first-time captain, and has otherwise opted for exciting-but-unproven players, perhaps with an eye to a home World Cup in 4 years’ time.

Australian rugby has been in decline for years, and the chickens are now coming home to roost for a union incapable of developing high-performance pathways for promising young players. For years Australia have failed to field a pack capable of competing at the highest level despite an array of talented backs, and this team is no different. While they will be able to hold their own against the likes of Wales and Fiji, they will be thanking their lucky stars they are not drawn alongside the likes of France or South Africa. Still, look for their backline to create moments of magic, particularly the exciting Jordan Petaia. 22-year old Carter Gordon has been selected as his team’s sole specialist ‘10’, and his development throughout the tournament will be an intriguing sub-plot, with only 7 test caps to his name. Jones obviously sees something in him, but the rest of the world will need convincing.

In the long term, I like the appointment of Jones as overseer of Australian rugby, as I think he can return them to relevance with time. This tournament has come a bit too soon for this young Australian team, but a good showing could set them up well to kick on to 2027. I see the quarter-finals as the best case scenario for this team, but Jones will be hard at work convincing them they can make serious waves. Whether they can then convince the rest of us is the key question.

### Simon Says - Fiji
With the aforementioned struggles of pool rivals Wales and Australia, the Flying Fijians are suddenly looking at the very realistic possibility of qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time since 2007 when, coincidentally, they upset Wales to secure a quarter-final place. The optimism surrounding this team is not solely down to the condition of their pool rivals, as Fiji enter the tournament in a rich vein of form. That they are doing so under a local coach, former Fiji player Simon Raiwalui, makes it all the more impressive and is a great sign for the sport going forward. Their only loss this year came in an impressive performance away to France, while they have comfortably despatched Samoa, Tonga and Japan, who may be considered their peers in the rugby world. However, it was their final warm-up game, against England in Twickenham, that has people seriously wondering how far this team could go.

On a rainy day in London last weekend, Fiji announced themselves to to world with a thrilling performance that compounded England’s woes. Displaying a composure and set-piece solidity long-missing from the Pacific Island nations, Fiji dealt with the conditions better than their illustrious counterparts, and struck with their trademark flair when it mattered most. Scoring some scintillating tries, Fiji tore England’s defence apart, and refused to crack when England’s pack tried to put the squeeze on them at scrum and maul time. They figure to be must-watch entertainment in this tournament, and have an embarrassment of rugby riches. Outside backs Semi Radradra and Waisea Nayacalevu can and will have a go from anywhere, while New Zealand-born out-half Caleb Muntz is an excellent distributor and goal-kicker. Levani Botia is a world-class operator at flanker(or centre), and is one of the best turnover-machines in the game.

Fiji’s fate is in their hands. If they can recreate the accuracy and ruthlessness of their performance against England, there is no reason to believe they cannot beat both Wales and Australia. A truly historic showing could see them make a semi-final with the favourable pool draw, and they will not be an easy opponent for any nation. For years Fiji have entertained, but failed to get over the line against nations with better organisation and discipline. This time around, they look primed to make waves.

### The Also-Rans - Georgia and Portugal
There was a time when Georgia were talked about as a 6 Nations replacement for a struggling Italy, but they have failed to really capitalise on that momentum and push on. They did record a famous 13-12 victory away to Wales last November, but other than that their notable performances against tier 1 opponents are few and far between. Generally showing up with a gigantic pack, Georgia are not a team any will enjoy facing, but they lack the quality to match the scoring of better opponents. I expect them to easily beat Portugal and run the other teams close for 50-60 minutes, but ultimately this will be another group stage exit without much fanfare.

Portugal arrive for only their second ever Rugby World Cup appearance, after losing every game at the 2007 tournament. The 16th-ranked nation in the world, they will be targeting Georgia as their best shot at a first tournament victory. Their preparation included a training match with the world’s number 1 side, Ireland, and hopefully they’ll have taken a few lessons from that which could stand to them going forward.

## Pool D
### Creevy Crawlers - Argentina
Flying under the radar entering the tournament, Argentina are exactly where they want to be. A nation built for World Cups, Argentina’s form in the intervening years between tournaments can almost always be dismissed. They have never truly challenged for a Rugby Championship title, and regularly lose their Autumn International games when travelling to the Northern Hemisphere. Yet every time rugby’s showpiece event rolls around, they seem to go up several gears, and their history of results in the competition would leave Irish fans green with envy, with multiple semi-final appearances and a stunning 3rd place finish in 2007. That being said, they failed to advance to the knockout stage 4 years ago following losses to England and France in the pool stage, and will be looking to return the level they will feel they belong at.

The 4 years since the last World Cup have seen Argentina take some massive scalps, with their first two victories over New Zealand(the second of which took place on New Zealand soil), and a first victory over England at Twickenham since 2006. Under veteran head coach Michael Cheika, Argentina are an incredibly solid outfit with an excellent scrum and aggressive defence. Scrum-half Tomás Cubelli and Nicolas Sanchez, due to win his 100th test cap during the tournament, are extremely adept at controlling a game and ensuring the match is played in the right territory with a strong kicking game that looks to put their opponents under pressure. If there is an area that can be an issue, it is their discipline, and if they get frustrated the game can get away from them very quickly. 

They bring an experienced side to France that will know what is required to go deep into the tournament, with 11 of their squad having been present for the 2015 semi-final run. Captain and hooker Julian Montoya has 89 test appearances, while the ageless Agustin Creevy will bring all the wisdom of 102 caps off the bench. They will play their toughest game on the first weekend, when they take on a weakened England. Victory there will almost guarantee progression to the quarter-finals, which will allow them to tailor their starting XVs for the rest of the pool stage to ensure they are fresh come the knockout stages. With a favourable quarter-final against Wales, Australia or Fiji, Argentina will be eyeing up a semi-final against whatever team emerges from the other side of the draw. If they can be firing on all cylinders at that stage of the tournament, there will be dreams of repeating the scenes in Buenos Aires from around this time last year.

### The Tackle School Alumni - England
It has been quite the fall from grace for England compared to where they were 4 years ago. Back then, Eddie Jones’ side was peaking at the perfect time, the culmination of a 4 year plan to secure a second Webb Ellis trophy. Their performance against the All Blacks in the semi-final was one of the finest displays of rugby ever witnessed, as their blend of aggression and accuracy blew the Kiwis away. At the time, the defeat a week later against South Africa was seen as a disappointment, but not soul-crushing, as much of the core of that squad would still be around in 4 years time. However, not once since have we seen them scale anything close to the heights of that clinical performance, and many of their players are way off where they were 4 years ago. England’s inability to bring through a new crop of world class players, highlighted by Eddie Jones during the week, have also contributed to the dire set of circumstances they currently find themselves in.

With the team flailing under Eddie Jones, the RFU made the huge decision to relieve him of his duties just 12 months out from the World Cup, and turned to Steve Borthwick, head coach of the Premiership-winning Leicester squad. To the RFU’s decision makers, Borthwick’s hard-nosed, back-to-basics style of play would be the perfect cure for England’s ailments, ignoring the fact that it was the opposite philosophy to where rugby’s top teams were trending. And so it has transpired that while England have been physical and can cause teams problems, they do not have anything resembling an attacking structure, and as such have struggled to score tries with any consistency. Not only are they bad, but they are boring, and if they fail to make an imprint on this World Cup then Borthwick’s tenure could be brief.

Under Borthwick and defence coach Kevin Sinner, one might have expected England to at least be adept at preventing the opposition from scoring, but instead they have leaked some huge points totals, no more evident than in a 53-10 defeat to France at Twickenham in this year’s 6 Nations. They hit rock-bottom last week as they were thoroughly outclassed by Fiji, again at home, for their first defeat by a non-Tier 1 nation. To add to their defensive woes, their discipline has also been a huge issue. Saracens duo Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola will both miss their key games against Argentina and Fiji due to suspensions for high tackles picked up in their warm-up games. The squad still contains some world-class, albeit out-of-form, players like Maro Itoje and Manu Tuilagi, and Freddy Steward is one of the finest full-backs in the game. Their attacking maul is incredibly potent, and should allow them to dominate less physically-imposing teams.

It is not a stretch to suggest that England are not even amongst the top 8 teams in this tournament, but they still stand an excellent chance of making a semi-final. I think Argentina will likely defeat them in the first game, but their pack will be too much for Japan and Samoa. Anything can happen in a quarter-final, and England will be looking to 2007 for inspiration, when a weak squad was blown out 36-0 at the pool stage by South Africa, before narrowly losing an intense rematch in the final weeks later. If England’s worst fears are confirmed however, they may be back in the coaching market sooner than anticipated.

### Upset Contenders - Japan and Samoa
Pool D contains two teams both capable of causing Argentina and England trouble. Japan in the last two World Cups have given us some of the greatest moments in tournament history, first with their incredible victory over the Springboks in Brighton in 2015, then their upset win over Ireland on home soil 4 years ago as they went on to top their pool. The true effects of that home World Cup are still yet to be fully felt however, and they have taken a bit of a step back. Their form this year hasn’t been fantastic, with a win over Tonga sandwiched between a narrow loss to pool rivals Samoa and heavy defeats to Fiji and Italy. With a smaller forward pack, Japan must box clever, and they will bring energy and electricity to all their fixtures. As many people’s 2nd-favourite team, they will have plenty of support, and veteran captain Michael Leitch brings experience and ballast to the side. If the Brave Blossoms do go on to cause some upsets, look for flying winger Kotaro Matsushima, one of the stars of the 2015 World Cup, to be right in the thick of things.

Like their fellow Pacific Island nations, Samoa have benefited from the change in eligibility rules to greatly strengthen their squad. Former All Blacks Lima Sopoaga, Charlie Faumuina and Steven Luatua have all swapped the black jersey for Samoan blue, and they are joined by former Wallaby Christian Leali'ifano. The results have been promising for Samoa, with wins over Tonga and Japan this year, as well as a highly impressive performance which could have seen them beat Ireland. Unlike Japan, they have the physical presence to live with England and Argentina, and may be the most likely side in the group to cause an upset. 2-time quarter-finalists, they have not made qualified for the knockout stage since 1995, and this year may represent their best chance so far to break that streak. Their showdown with England in the final week of the pool stages should be a must-watch.

### The Also-Rans - Chile
Chile qualified for their first ever Rugby World Cup after a 52-51 aggregate victory over tournament mainstays the USA last year, in a promising sign for World Rugby’s attempts to grow the game. While they are unlikely to do more than make up the numbers, the kind pool draw has given them a chance at a historic victory, and I would have to imagine they have been targeting the Japan match for some time. Regardless of what happens, it is great to see new teams qualifying, and hopefully Chile can generate some momentum from the appearance.


## Final Predictions

In the end, I just feel like this French team are on a mission, having been building towards this moment for over half a decade. They have some injuries, but their depth is second-to-none, and in Antoine Dupont they have the best player in the world. Armed with the immense backing of the home crowd, I’m not sure any team can reach the level required to knock off this French outfit. I think they will show some nerves early on but narrowly defeat the All Blacks, and grow into the tournament from there. A quarter-final against the Springboks will await them, as I see the ‘Boks finishing as runners-up in Pool B, behind Ireland. Scotland will push both teams hard, but ultimately come up short and get eliminated at the pool stage. Fiji will be the surprise package in Pool C, and I like their chances of turning over both Wales and Australia. I like Wales to win that elimination game with the Aussies, as Gatland gets one over on Eddie Jones. In my bracket, Pool D is decided as Argentina beats England on the opening weekend but there are no further upsets in that pool, meaning they go through in that order.

In the quarter-finals, France vs. South Africa would be a titanic tussle, with the fact it is played in France the only reason I am picking them to emerge victorious, though feeling a little worse for wear I would imagine. They will meet the winner of Argentina versus Wales, and I am backing the South Americans to get the job done here simply as the more talented side. On the other side of the draw, Ireland will face New Zealand in a rematch of 2019’s quarter-final, with the outcome reversed this time around. Ireland are a better side this year, and they stymied the All Blacks’ potent attack in their test series win last year. I see them doing the same here, and finally progressing to a World Cup semi-final. Also making their debut at the World Cup semi-final stage(according to my bracket at least), are Fiji, who I fancy to repeat their Twickenham upset and knock England out. Fiji’s flair and desire to play will see them outscore their more regimented opponents for a victory that will be popular the world over.

While Argentina and Fiji will both be tough opponents, these semi-finals are some of the most lopsided we’re likely to see. As long as France and Ireland aren’t in dire straits with regard to their depth charts by this stage, having come through some huge clashes, I see them taking narrow victories that are perhaps closer on the scoreboard than in reality. At that point, the 6 Nations rivals will meet on the biggest stage of all, with a first-time Champion guaranteed. Despite Ireland beating France earlier this year, I think France just about get over the line in this one, with Thomas Ramos kicking the winning drop goal in a high-scoring affair to send the Stade de France into raptures, and leaving Irish hearts broken but proud.

### Player of the Tournament: Thomas Ramos
Realistically, if France are champions, this award likely goes to Antoine Dupont. But Thomas Ramos has a big role to play at this tournament, and it is his automatic goal-kicking that could be the difference in the tightest games. He is unpredictable, and is known to produce moments of absolute brilliance and moments of madness. I’m backing him to have more of the former as France are crowned champions.
